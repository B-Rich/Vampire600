Vampire600
==========

Core for the Vampire 600 Amiga accelerator project.

The source for the 0.1 core of Majsta's Vampire 600 accelerator project has been available for some time,
but so far it seems not many people have experimented with it.  In the hope of making it easier for others
to play with the project, I've pushed the code in its current state to a GitHub repo, which people can
check out, fork, experiment with and keep track of changes.

I've also pushed a repository which contains my own experimental codebase for the Vampire 500 prototype
board which Majsta sent me some months ago.  That codebase isn't currently in a working state, but contains
a lot of code that might be useful for the Vampire 600 project.
